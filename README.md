# Memory-Ultrapack
Memory Ultrapack was my first WIndows Store App and was developed from Sept-Dec 2014. Featuring various practice modes, games, and self-tests, Memory Ultrapack aims to encourage users to enhance their recall capacity in a fun environment.

DESCRIPTION

Do you remember what you ate two nights ago? Would you be able to recall the items on your shopping list if you were to have left it at home? One of our greatest assets is our memory so let's take action to improve it. Memory Ultrapack features a variety of ways to help you improve your memory: from counting cards to memorizing numbers to recalling lists of capital and lowercase letters, along with almost a dozen quirky symbols, to racing against the clock. Do you feel like working out your brain? Head over to the at-your-own-pace practice modes. What to stimulate your child's attention to something other than video games? Play a couple fun (and somewhat tricky) games. And as your memory improves, you can challenge yourself to one of four tests and track your progress through the highscores page. Memory Ultrapack is deisgned to encourage users to stretch their memories and it is our hope that Memory Ultrapack may serve your needs.
